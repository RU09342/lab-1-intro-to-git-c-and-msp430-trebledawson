# Introduction
This folder contains a header and main for a simple calculator in C. 

# Header
The header file was provided by Russell Trafford and outlines the behavior of the program. 

The function accepts two integers, num1 and num2, as inputs, as well as a char indicating which operation is to be performed.

# Main
The main specifies the operation of the function. 

The function first examines the input operator to determine the operation to be performed.

Then, the function uses the built-in C operators to perform the appropriate operation. 

If the operator argument is not a valid operator, the function returns -1.
